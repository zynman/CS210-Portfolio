# Project3

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.: This project was solving the issue that the grocery store had to help optimize their product lineup. 
    What did you do particularly well?: Produced working code.
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?: I could probably work on leaving comments as well as optimizing performance.
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?:Using stack overflow was a great way to identify common or simple errors I was making and I found it challenging to get started and understand the requirements but once that was done then it was pretty sustainable until completion. 
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?: I think all the skills from this project will be trasnferable.
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Used easy to read naming as well as leaving comments and documentation.
